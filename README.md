The goal for this The Odin Project is to create a calculator that runs in the browser.

The calculator is capable of handling the four basic operators and decimal numbers, accessing the previous calculation's answer, deleting the last input and clearing it all.

This project required the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

In order to complete this project it was important to properly anchor event listeners, manipulate the DOM and implement sound scripting on Javascript. The use of classes and a constructor was essential to create a history of the previous states of the calculator.

Beyond this file and folder structure management was important to keep a coherent project. Linking files in an appropriate manner was useful to preserve modularity. Refactoring played a major role nearing its completion and vastly improved its readability.

Finally, this project would not have been able to be completed without extensive use of debugger and a life server.
